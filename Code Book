In this project there were 2 data sources of main interest: training and test data.  Each data set had 561 unlabeled variables
with no descriptive values.  For each data source, there is another two data sets: its respective activity labels and its respective
subjects.  Also, in different files there is a data set for activity names and features.

The activities are stored in a file named activity_labels.txt.  The activities are:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

The features are the measurements done on each subject for each activity.  The features (measurements) are:
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

Both, training and test data sets are merged in order to complete the whole analysis and thus, be able to create the tidy data set.
